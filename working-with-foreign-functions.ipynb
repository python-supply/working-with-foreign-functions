    "Python offers a rich set of capabilities via the built-in [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) library that make it possible to invoke (or wrap in a Python function) foreign functions that have been implemented using another language (such as C/C++) and compiled into shared libraries. This article reviews the basics of employing foreign functions by demonstrating how to load and apply to the above use case the instance of the [GNU C Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) available on most operating systems. The same techniques can be used for any shared library. An alternative approach used by some popular Python packages is briefly reviewed, as well."
